This is the back-end code for the RRPS_PAT system, which contains the Enhanced BPSO implementation written in Java 8.

You can find the 'MainApp' file in the 'com.VisNeo4j.App package'.
This file contains the declaration of EBPSO and the declaration of a sample Knapsack problem as well as the Air traffic management problem.

You can tune the parameters of the metaheuristic and run the MainApp file as a Java application to solve either of these problems.
During the optimization, the console will print the global best (variables, objectives, constraints etc) after each function evaluation.

The 'com.VisNeo4j.App.Problems.Knapsack' package contains all the available Knapsack problem instances to choose from.

For the Air traffic management problem con also specify the specific conditions of the problem, 
    such as the time-window to consider, objectives priorization and constraints.
